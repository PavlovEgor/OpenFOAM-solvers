# DLBFoam-Hydrogen-Tutorials
This repository provides advanced hydrogen combustion tutorial cases with enhanced transport modelling with [FickianTransportFoam](https://github.com/Aalto-CFD/FickianTransportFoam) and chemistry acceleration with [DLBFoam](https://github.com/Aalto-CFD/DLBFoam) for OpenFOAM.

The detailed discussion and validation of the provided tutorial cases are openly available in Ref. [[1]](#1)

The field data and mesh files that are too large to fit in github are aviable in https://doi.org/10.23729/fd-d0f0dedb-1e92-35b0-b1e4-da3e58435ea4
## Tutorial cases

The provided tutorial cases represent the following:

* [2D laminar freely propagating premixed flame](2D_planar_flame/README.md)
* [2D axi-symmetric laminar non-premixed jet flame](2D_jet_flame/README.md)
* [3D turbulent non-premixed flame (HYLON, Flame A)](3D_HYLON_flame_A/README.md)
* [3D turbulent premixed flame (AHEAD)](3D_AHEAD/README.md)

Chemistry is modeled using the chemical kinetic mechanism of Capurso et al. [[3]](#3). Source code for the PyJac generated analytical Jacobian is given in the *mech* folder. Compile the Jacobian first by executing *./Allwmake* before running the tutorials and make sure that you have a valid OpenFOAM 10 installation with DLBFoam and FickianTransportFoam libraries.

As there are many more experimental benchmarks of various combustion phenomena that have not been tested, we would be happy to receive your contribution using the **DLBFoam** and reporting the speed-up and scaling effects against standard solvers.


## Citation

If you use our tutorial cases, please cite the paper discussing these test cases [[1]](#1), together with the DLBFoam paper noted in Ref. [[2]](#2).
