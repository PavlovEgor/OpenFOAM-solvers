# 3D turbulent premixed flame (AHEAD)
This is a validation study of the AHEAD premixed burner carried out under stable conditions at an equivalence ratio of 0.6. The simulations were conducted using OpenFOAM with FickianTransportFoam and DLBFoam, as published in Ref.[[1]](#1) and Ref.[[2]](#2). AHEAD is a premixed swirl-stabilized burner, which is enhanced for flashback over a wide range of operating conditions, using hydrogen as fuel. The experimental work was carried out by Reichel et al. [[3]](#3). 

## Case description
Air is introduced through the plenum, from where it is subdivided into three main paths to access the cylindrical mixing chamber: 1) axial inlet, providing the axial momentum (8 mm diameter), 2) 8 radial slits, creating tangential momentum (swirl motion), and 3) 12 dilution holes, preventing boundary layer flashback. Fuel is introduced through 16 fuel inlet ports into the mixing chamber; each fuel inlet port is 0.8 mm in diameter, encircling the truncated center body at the bottom of the mixing chamber. The diameter of the mixing chamber is 34 mm.

## Numerical setup

The solver is reactingFoam. The simulation setup incorporates a species-specific constant Lewis number transport model to account for the fast diffusion of light hydrogen atoms. Details regarding the calculation of species-specific Lewis numbers and the conditions used in the present simulations are provided in the Supplementary Data file Section of Ref [[1]](#1) . The turbulent Schmidt number  is set to 0.75, and the turbulent Prandtl number to 0.85. To analyze the implemented transport models, six simulations are performed in total: three non-reactive flows to assess mesh independence and three reactive flows. More details can be found in the manuscript or the present case setup files in Ref [[1]](#1).

## Execution
Just execute the ./Allrun file


## PostProcessing/Validation

To post-process the simulation data, you can use Python or Paraview to visualize the flow fields. For sampling, a sampleDict is provided in the system folder that can be used for plotting the experimental data over a line at different axial heights. The following image show the OH volume rendering filed inside the domain.

The numerical results extracted  using the sampleDict are compared against the experimental results. [[3]](#3).

**Total speed-up compared to standard OpenFOAM solver was around 237.5.**
